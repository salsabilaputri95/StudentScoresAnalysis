# StudentScoresAnalysis

This project involves analyzing a dataset of student scores, student_scores.csv, which contains two columns: Hours and Scores. The objective is to find insights from the data and to determine the best predictive model using Linear Regression and Decision Tree Regressor.

The dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eYFfxkOCKKiabdkgy64NbM44YjwwIHOA/view?usp=sharing).

**Goals**:

1. **Understand the Relationship**: Analyze the relationship between the number of study hours and the scores obtained.
2. **Model Training**: Train two different models - Linear Regression and Decision Tree Regressor.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the models to determine which one better predicts student scores.
4. **Visualization**: Visualize the data and the predictions to gain deeper insights.

**Insights**:

1. **Outlier Analysis**: The boxplot shows that there are no significant outliers in the data for `Hours`.
2. **Scatter Plot**: The scatter plot suggests a positive correlation between the number of study hours and the scores.
3. **Linear Regression Results**:
    - The Linear Regression model has an R-squared value of `0.9553509219739938`.
    - The intercept of the model is ` 2.4803670915057623`.
    - The coefficient of the model is `[9.71409219]`.
4. **Decision Tree Results**:
    - The Decision Tree Regressor model has an R-squared value of `0.8803859268443893`.

**Visualizations**

- **Boxplot**: Displays the distribution of hours spent studying.
- **Pair Plot**: Shows the relationship between hours studied and scores obtained.
- **Prediction Plots**:
  - **Linear Regression**: Comparison of actual scores and predicted scores.
  - **Decision Tree**: Comparison of actual scores and predicted scores.

**Advices**

1. **Model Choice**: Based on the R-squared values, choose the model that provides a higher value as it better explains the variance in the student scores.
2. **Further Analysis**: Consider adding more features to the dataset, such as study methods, types of subjects, etc., to improve model performance.
3. **Regular Updates**: Regularly update the dataset with new student scores to keep the model trained on the latest data.
4. **Cross-Validation**: Implement cross-validation to ensure the model's robustness and avoid overfitting.
